Tori no Yokota is a fantastic izakaya in Tachikawa - five minutes from the train station - specializing in hot pot style dishes.

It's a tiny hole-in-the-wall shop. It's not on a main road. You'd be hard pressed to find it on your own. But it's one of those rare finds that you'll be glad you took the chance to discover it.

They serve hot pot dishes, grilled chicken (yakitori), and a wide variety of other common izakaya foods - plus a great selection of adult beverages.

For a great evening warming up to a delicious hot pot with a famous Japanese beer in hand, you will enjoy Tori no Yokota. The owner is a fun, outgoing guy --- even if he can't speak English you'll find him entertaining.
